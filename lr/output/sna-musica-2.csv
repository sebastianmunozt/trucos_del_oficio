The rise of digital platforms has enabled musicians to collaborate more efficiently across disciplines, facilitating the co-creation and release of musical works. This collaboration mode has influenced the evolution of musical genres and promoted diverse musical culture through innovation and integration. This paper uses social network analysis to select a relatively popular digital platform for the young Chinese generation, Bilibili and ACG music, as the research object. The study analysed the cooperation network of 136 ACG music content creators (Up zhu) in 27 music works to reveal how musicians collaborate to co-create, release and distribute their music works through the platform. The network shows a high clustering coefficient, indicating the formation of close-knit groups among music content creators. The analysis identified 14 cohesive groups and 10 key bridge-builders, facilitating isolated groups’ connection. This co-creation has a profound impact on the relationships between creators, diversifies the styles of music that are produced, and fosters the growth of culturally diverse subcultures. The role of key bridge-builders is to enhance the network’s influence and support marginal creators, thereby promoting the creation of diverse musical works and cultural communities.;2024-08;05/03/2025 22:46;19/03/2025 15:43;05/03/2025 22:46;451-455;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;IEEE Xplore;;;;C:\Users\sebastian\Zotero\storage\KDU3A37J\10675786.html;;;"✅; Music; ACG music; Automatic generation control; Bilibili; Collaboration; Costs; Federated learning; music content creator; social network analysis; Social networking (online); Technological innovation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2024 International Conference on Culture-Oriented Science & Technology (CoST);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"7TRU96FD,""conferencePaper"",""2024"",""Wang, Manlin";" Jiang, Ting"",""A Social Network Analysis of Musician Co-creation on Digital Platform"",""2024 International Conference on Culture-Oriented Science & Technology (CoST)"","""","""",""10.1109/CoST64302.2024.00094"",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675786"",""Music creation involves collaborative efforts from various individuals, including composers, lyricists, singers, producers, distributors, and others.

Hence, in this paper, we model the evolution of DJ Khaled's collaboration network as nine different networks that incrementally consider the albums of his discography. The network of each album includes the collaborations from previous ones and adds the collaborations from the new album. The artists are represented as nodes and the edges are the number of songs they appear together. Our focus is to answer whether or not: (i) we can identify meaningful communities in this network; and (2) there is an artist who has greater influence as networks emerges. By using the network average clustering coefficient, we found that the artists in the the network tend to naturally cluster in a logical manner. As a result, we identified nine communities, six of them are meaningful, and we identified the rapper Rick Ross as the most influential artist of the network.";17/10/2017;24/03/2025 19:09;24/03/2025 19:09;24/03/2025;425–428;;;;;;Using Complex Networks to Assess Collaboration in Rap Music;WebMedia '17;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;New York, NY, USA;;;;;;ACM Digital Library;;;;C:\Users\sebastian\Desktop\PRODUCCION\00.

Hence, in this paper, we model the evolution of DJ Khaled's collaboration network as nine different networks that incrementally consider the albums of his discography. The network of each album includes the collaborations from previous ones and adds the collaborations from the new album. The artists are represented as nodes and the edges are the number of songs they appear together. Our focus is to answer whether or not: (i) we can identify meaningful communities in this network";" and (2) there is an artist who has greater influence as networks emerges. By using the network average clustering coefficient, we found that the artists in the the network tend to naturally cluster in a logical manner.

Music is a massively relational cultural form, involving interactions among composers, poets, arrangers, conductors, and performers, among others. The reality of music history thus emerges as a complex network of relationships, unfolding and changing over time. Song production, in particular, centers on poet-composer-singer collaborations. Many Arab music histories highlight narratives of the stars, presented in historical and cultural context, but neglect the broader network of productive relationships. However many important musical figures are not celebrities, and the full complexity of the non-linear network can only be grasped holistically, including big data empirical analysis, not pointillistically through case studies of celebrities. Such holistic analysis can reveal surprising emergent, structural patterns that are not apparent in any single narrative. Social network analysis (SNA) offers a powerful suite of tools enabling such an approach, including metrics for centrality and the detection of cohesive subgroups. Starting with a large dataset of songs broadcast on Egyptian radio, I extract a network of poet-composer collaborations, and apply SNA algorithms to reveal its social structure. I then interpret that structure in light of wider socio-cultural and historical factors.

In this work, we combine social networks and data mining techniques to analyze musical success from a genre-oriented perspective. Our goal is to mine exceptional collaboration patterns in success-based genre networks where the success deviates from the average. We conduct our analyses for global and eight regional markets, and the results show that each market has specific patterns of genre connections in which success is above average.

Utilizing social network analysis, this research uncovers a power law distribution in these networks, reflecting a scale-free market configuration.

We use Social Network Analysis to reconstruct the structure of the relationships that have bound together the Bologna’s singers-songwriters scene in its relationship with the urban context. Making use of the Newman Community Detection algorithm, we find a dense, vital and collaborative scene, organized around four different, musician-centered communities, that are permeable to collaborations with each other.
